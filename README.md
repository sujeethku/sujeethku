# Hi, I'm Sujeeth 👋

I’m a Senior Product Manager at Amazon based in Sydney, Australia.  
In my day-to-day work, I solve problems that impact **Amazon’s customers, sellers, and core business teams**.  
My focus is on building products that:

- Enhance customer and seller experience  
- Improve business efficiency and revenue outcomes  
- Reduce operational cost-to-serve at scale  

Outside work, I build **practical, data-driven and AI-powered tools**.  
I use a *vibe-coding* approach, rapidly turning ideas into working apps using LLM-assisted development, which gives me hands-on exposure to productizing Python, data workflows, and AI interventions.  

I treat these projects as real product builds: clear scope, end-to-end architecture, iterative shipping, and strong focus on usability.

### 🔭 What I’m working on

- **Vibe coding as a PM**  
  Applying a rapid-prototyping workflow where LLMs act as an engineering multiplier — allowing me to turn product ideas into functional prototypes, validate concepts quickly, and iterate with real user interactions.

- **AI, RAG, and Agentic product capabilities**  
  Deepening practical intuition for how LLMs, retrieval systems, and agentic architectures influence product strategy, quality benchmarks, system design, and user experience. I actively build small end-to-end solutions to better understand real-world constraints and opportunities.

- **Building tools the way PMs think**  
  Designing lightweight apps that combine clean UX, structured workflows, and simple data pipelines. Each project strengthens my ability to translate ambiguous problems into technical scoping, evaluation frameworks, and working features, even with minimal coding requirements.

- **Expanding a portfolio of practical AI-powered apps**  
  Continuously shipping compact, useful tools in Python and lightweight web frameworks. These projects serve as hands-on learning environments to explore AI interventions, automate tasks, and prototype product ideas at speed.

### 🧭 My Work & Interests

- 🎯 **Role**: Senior Product Manager @ Amazon  
  Focused on solving customer, seller, and business problems across emerging stores, improving experience, driving efficiency, and reducing cost-to-serve.

- 🌏 **Location**: Sydney, Australia  

- 🧠 **Interests**: AI agents, RAG systems, data-driven product design, system thinking, and building compact tech-driven tools that solve real user pain points.

- 🔧 **Hands-on exploration**:  
  I use side projects to deepen exposure to practical AI, lightweight architectures, vibe coding, and rapid prototyping. Each build strengthens my technical intuition without requiring heavy engineering overhead.

### 🛠️ Tech I’m exploring through my projects

- **Python** for stitching together fast prototypes, data workflows, and lightweight automation  
- **Flask & simple web architectures** to convert prototypes into shareable interfaces  
- **SQLite & SQL** to design compact data layers and analytics features  
- **LLM-assisted development workflows** (vibe-coding) for rapid idea → prototype execution  
- **AI fundamentals** including RAG setups, evaluation frameworks, and agentic decision flows  
- **System design basics** required to scale small tools into more structured solutions  

My goal is to become a PM who **thinks and can build** with enough depth to design better products, evaluate trade-offs, and collaborate effectively with technical teams.

### 🌱 How I work on side projects

- **Start with a real problem**  
  Every project begins with a clear pain point, something I personally experience or observe in users.

- **Define a minimal, meaningful scope**  
  I avoid “demo code” and instead build the smallest version that delivers a real outcome or insight.

- **Prototype fast using vibe coding**  
  I use LLMs as an engineering accelerator, combining product instincts with guided implementation to ship quickly.

- **Design with usability in mind**  
  Even early prototypes include clean workflows, intuitive UX, and clear separation of logic and data.

- **Learn through iteration**  
  Each feature adds a new layer of technical exposure, whether it's data modeling, routing, validation, or AI integration.

- **Document everything**  
  Every repo captures the evolution of the idea, making it easy to revisit, extend, or apply the same learning to future tools.

My projects are intentionally small, focused, and end-to-end, allowing me to explore the intersection of **AI, UX, data, and product strategy** in a hands-on way.
